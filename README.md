# rag-chat
The repo is to implement the RAG pattern. RAG is a pattern that uses pretrained LLM along with your own data to generate responses. The demo includes loading the data into QDrant (Vector DB) and used Semantic Kernel to orchestrate and generate responses from the vector DB.

## Configure your environment
Before you get started, make sure you have the following requirements in place:
- [Visual Studio Code](http://aka.ms/vscode) with extensions:
  - [C# Extension](https://aka.ms/csharp/vscode)
  - [Azure Functions Extension](https://aka.ms/azfn/vscode)
- [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://aka.ms/net70) for building and deploying .NET 7 projects.
- [Azure Function Core Tools 4.x](https://aka.ms/azfn/coretools) for managing Azure Functions
- [Azure OpenAI API key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1302744/openai-api-key-azure-ai-studio) for using the Azure OpenAI API (or click [here](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu) to signup).

Then, open a terminal and clone this repo with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chinu333/rag-chat.git
```

## Configure Keys/Endpoints
Congigure keys/endpoints in following placses:
- src/myfunc/Program.cs
- src/importmemories/Programs.cs


## Run the function locally
1. Run your Azure Function locally by opening a terminal, changing directory to your Azure Function project (e.g., `rag-chat/src/myfunc`), and starting the function by running
    ```bash
    func start
    ```
    > Make note of the URL displayed (e.g., `http://localhost:7071/api/MyChatFunction`).

1. Start the test console application
   Open a second terminal and change directory to the `chatconsole` project folder (e.g., `rag-chat/src/chatconsole`) and run the application using the Azure Function URL.
   ```bash
   dotnet run http://localhost:7071/api/MyChatFunction
   ```
1. Type a message and press enter to verify that we are able to chat with the AI!
    ```
    Input: Hello, how are you?
    AI: Hello! As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning properly and ready to 
    assist you. How can I help you today?
    ```
   
 1. Now let's try to ask about something that is not in the current AI model, such as "What was Microsoft's total revenue for 2022?"
    ```
    Input: What was Microsoft's cloud revenue for 2022?
    AI: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide information about Microsoft's cloud revenue for 2022 as it is not yet 
    available. Microsoft's fiscal year 2022 ends on June 30, 2022, and the company typically releases its 
    financial results a few weeks after the end of the fiscal year. However, Microsoft's cloud revenue for 
    fiscal year 2021 was $59.5 billion, an increase of 34% from the previous year.
    ```
    As you can see the AI is a bit out of date with its answers.

    Next we'll add a 'knowledge base' to the chat to help answer questions such as those above more accurately.


# Memories of Enterprise Data
Semantic Kernel's memory stores are used to integrate data from your knowledge base into AI interactions.
Any data can be added to a knowledge base and you have full control of that data and who it is shared with.
SK uses [embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings?tabs=command-line) to encode data and store it in a 
vector database. Using a vector database also allows us to use vector search engines to quickly find the most 
relevant data for a given query that we then share with the AI. In this chapter, we'll add a memory store to 
our chat function, import the Microsoft revenue data, and use it to answer the question from Chapter 1.

## Configure your environment
Before you get started, make sure you have the following additional requirements in place:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for hosting the [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) vector search engine.
   > Note that a different vector store, such as Pinecone or Weviate, could be leveraged.

## Deploy Qdrant VectorDB and Populate Data
In this section we deploy the Qdrant vector database locally and populate it with example data (i.e., Microsoft's 2022 10-K financial report). This will take approximately 15 minutes to import and will use OpenAIâ€™s embedding generation service to create embeddings for the 10-K.

1. Start Docker Desktop and wait until it is running.

1. Open a terminal and use Docker to pull down the container image for Qdrant.
    ```bash
    docker pull qdrant/qdrant
    ```

1. Change directory to the root of this repo (e.g., `rag-chat`) and create a `./data/qdrant` directory for Qdrant to use as persistent storage.
   Then start the Qdrant container on port `6333` using the `./data/qdrant` folder as the persistent storage location.
    ```bash
    mkdir ./data/qdrant
    docker run --name mychat -p 6333:6333 -v "$(pwd)/data/qdrant:/qdrant/storage" qdrant/qdrant
    ```
    > To stop the container, in another terminal window run `docker container stop mychat; docker container rm mychat;`.

1. Open a second terminal and change directory to the `importmemories` project folder in this repo (e.g., `rag-chat/src/importmemories`). Run the `importmemories` tool with the command below to populate the vector database with your data.
    > Make sure the `--collection` argument matches the `collectionName` variable in the `SearchMemoriesAsync` method above.
    
    > **Note:** This may take several minutes to several hours depending on the size of your data. This repo contains 
      Microsoft's 2022 10-K financial report data as an example which should normally take about 15 minutes to import.
        
	```bash
    dotnet run -- --memory-type qdrant --memory-url http://localhost:6333 --collection ms10k --text-file ../../data/ms10k.txt
	```
    > When importing your own data, try to import all files at the same time using multiple `--text-file` arguments. 
    > This example leverages incremental indexes which are best constructed when all data is present. 
    
    > If you want to reset the memory store, delete and recreate the directory in step 2, or create a new directory to use.

## Run the function locally
1. With Qdrant running and populated, run your Azure Function locally by opening a terminal, changing directory to your Azure Function project (e.g., `rag-chat/src/myfunc`), and starting the function by running
    ```bash
    func start
    ```
    > Make a note of the URL displayed (e.g., `http://localhost:7071/api/MyChatFunction`).

1. Start the test console application
   Open a second terminal and change directory to the `chatconsole` project folder (e.g., `rag-chat/src/chatconsole`) and run the application using the Azure Function URL.
   ```bash
   dotnet run http://localhost:7071/api/MyChatFunction
   ```
1. Type a message and press enter to verify that we are able to chat with the AI!
    ```
    Input: Hello, how are you?
    AI: Hello! As an AI language model, I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning properly and ready to 
    assist you. How can I help you today?
    ```
   
 1. Now let's try ask the same question from before about Microsoft's 2022 revenue
    ```
    Input: What was Microsoft's cloud revenue for 2022?
    AI: Microsoft's cloud revenue for 2022 was $91.2 billion.
    ```
    > The AI now has the ability to search through the Microsoft 10-K financial report and find the answer to our question.
    > Let's try another...
    ```
    Input: Did linkedin's revenue grow in 2022?
    AI: Yes, LinkedIn's revenue grew in 2022. It increased by $3.5 billion or 34% driven by a strong job 
    market in the Talent Solutions business and advertising demand in the Marketing Solutions business.
